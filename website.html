    The Ferrari SF90 Stradale (Type F173) is a mid-engine PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) sports car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. The car shares its name with the SF90 Formula One car with 90 standing for the 90th anniversary of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team and "Stradale", an Italian word for "made for the road".[4]
    
    Specifications
    Battery and driving modes
    The car has a 7.9 kWh lithium-ion battery for regenerative braking, giving the car 26 km (16 miles) of electric range.[5][2] The car comes with four driving modes depending on road conditions. The modes are changed by the eManettino knob present on the steering wheel.
    
    The eDrive mode runs the car only on the electric motors. The Hybrid mode runs the car on both the internal combustion engine and the electric motors and is the car's default mode. In this mode, the car's onboard computer (called control logic) also turns off the engine if the conditions are ideal in order to save fuel while allowing the driver to start the engine again. The Performance mode keeps the engine running in order to charge the batteries and keeps the car responsive in order for optimum performance. The Qualify mode uses the powertrain to its full potential.
    
    The control logic system makes use of three primary areas: the high-voltage controls of the car (including the batteries), the RAC-e (Rotation Axis Control-electric) torque vectoring system, and the MGUK along with the engine and gearbox.[6]
    
    Powertrain
    The SF90 Stradale is equipped with three electric motors, adding a combined output of 162 kW (220 PS; 217 hp)[7] to a twin-turbocharged V8 engine rated at a power output of 735 kW (1,000 PS; 986 hp) at 7,500 rpm.[6][7][8] and a maximum torque of 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) at 6,000 rpm.[9][10]
    
    The engine is an evolution of the unit found in the 488 Pista and the F8 Tributo models.[11] The engine's capacity is now 4.0 L (3,990 cc) by increasing each cylinder bore to 88 mm (3.46 in). The intake and exhaust of the engine have been completely modified. The cylinder heads of the engine are now narrower and the all-new central fuel injectors run at a pressure of 35 MPa (5,100 psi). The assembly for the turbochargers is lower than that of the exhaust system and the engine sits 50 mm (2.0 in) lower in the chassis than the other mid-engine V8 models in order to maintain a lower centre of gravity. The engine utilises a smaller flywheel and an inconel exhaust manifold.[6]
    
    The front wheels are powered by two electric motors (one for each wheel), providing torque vectoring. They also function as the reversing gear, as the main transmission (eight-speed dual-clutch) does not have a reversing gear.[5]
    
    Transmission
    
    The engine of the SF90 Stradale is mated to a new 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. The new transmission is 10 kg (22 lb) lighter and more compact than the existing 7-speed transmission used by the other offerings of the manufacturer partly due to the absence of a dedicated reverse gear since reversing is provided by the electric motors mounted on the front axle. The new transmission also has a 30% faster shift time (200 milliseconds).[12][13]
    
    Interior
    
    A 410 mm (16 in) curved display located behind the steering wheel displays various vital statistics of the car to the driver. The car also employs a new head-up display that would reconfigure itself according to the selected driving mode. The steering wheel is carried over from the F8 but now features multiple capacitive touch interfaces to control the various functions of the car. Other conventional levers and buttons are retained. The interior will also channel the sound of the engine to the driver according to the manufacturer.[13]
    
    Handling
    
    The SF90 Stradale employs eSSC (electric Side Slip Control) which controls the torque distribution to all four wheels of the car. The eSSC is combined with eTC (electric Tractional Control), a new brake-by-wire system which combines the traditional hydraulic braking system and electric motors to provide optimal regenerative braking and torque vectoring.
    
    Chassis
    
    The car's all-new chassis combines aluminium and carbon fibre to improve structural rigidity and provide a suitable platform for the car's hybrid system. The car has a total dry weight of 1,570 kg (3,461 lb) after combining the 270 kg (595 lb) weight of the electric system.
    
    Performance
    
    Ferrari states that the SF90 Stradale is capable of accelerating from a standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.5 seconds, 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 6.7 seconds and can attain a top speed of 340 km/h (211 mph).[14] It is the fastest Ferrari road car on their Fiorano Circuit as of 2020, seven tenths of a second faster than the LaFerrari.[15</P>
